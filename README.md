## Known Bugs
Functionality-wise, I do not have any bugs that I know of. However, since I was relying slightly on React Bootstrap this assignment to create my dropdowns and list groups, I could not really get CSS to work in conjunction with the CSS already provided by React Bootstrap. I was able to achieve results for most of my components, but for my list groups and check boxes, the outlines are quite light and I wanted to make the border darker for contrast purposes, but the CSS I wrote for those components did not register.
